# Tenzies-Game

This Tenzies Game project is the capstone project of a React course on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com).  
The execution of the project requires implementing all the logic and methods taught throughout the course. It also introduced me to the **practical use of the React `useRef` hook alongside `useEffect`.**

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: for structuring the app  
- **CSS**: for styling and layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: for logic and interactivity  
- **React**: for building UI components and managing state  
- **nanoid**: for generating custom IDs  
- **react-confetti**: for displaying celebratory effects when the game is won

- **Dice Selection**: Users can hold dice showing their chosen number  
- **Roll Until Match**: Players roll the dice until all dice display the same number  
- **React Concepts in Practice**: Reinforces concepts of state management, event handling, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and the integration of third-party dependencies
